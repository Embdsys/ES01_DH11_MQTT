**Use this bash file to change the setting on the ESP01 such as ssid,passwrd...**
$ssid
$wifiPassword
$mqttServerIp
$inTopic
$outTopic

** unfortunately I cant get the arduino ide to spit out the .bin file reliably**
So do that shit by presing shift+ctrl+s

**Once its done use esptool to load the file onto the ESP01**
